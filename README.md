# Traffic Sign Detection with PyTorch

Welcome to the Traffic Sign Detection project! This repository contains a deep learning model designed to detect and classify traffic signs in images or real-time footage. Utilizing the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and PyTorch, our model aims to provide high accuracy in identifying various traffic signs, making it a valuable tool for autonomous driving systems and traffic monitoring.

## Project Overview

The Traffic Sign Detection project leverages a CNN model implemented in PyTorch to recognize traffic signs from static images or video streams. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of traffic signs, enabling it to detect and classify a wide range of sign types under different environmental conditions.

## Features


- High accuracy CNN model implemented in PyTorch.
- Utilization of torchvision transforms for image preprocessing.
- Custom dataset and DataLoader for efficient training and validation.
- Evaluation metrics for model performance assessment.
